# dtfls

an attempt at
[dendritic](https://github.com/Doc-Steve/dendritic-design-with-flake-parts/tree/main)
configuration of nixos and nix-darwin and home-manager

largely built atop the endless patience of
[@Michael-C-Buckley](https://github.com/Michael-C-Buckley) and the other
denizens of the [vimjoyer discord](https://discord.gg/4PRCEduR)

## todo

- set up the nix-darwin stuff
- splashdown:
  - turn off screens from idle
  - some sort of desktop setup
- ssh authorized keys and config
- sops for private keys!
- tmux configuration
- alacritty configuration
- [proxmox via nix](https://github.com/SaumonNet/proxmox-nixos)?
